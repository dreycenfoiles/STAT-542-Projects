\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we were tasked with predicting the weekly sales of
different departments at several Walmart stores using data from 45 different
stores in different regions.

\section{Data processing}
The data categories in the raw dataset are as follows: Store, Dept, Date,
Weekly\_Sales, IsHoliday. To generate the training data, test data, and extra
training folds, we first remove Date and replace it with two new categories:
Week and Year. We assigned a number from 1 to 52 for each week, and a number
from 1 to 3 for each year. These categories are much easier for a statistical model to interpret.

\section{Methods}
To do the regression, we initally tried using a GradientBoostedTree from
scikit-learn, but it did not perfrom very well. Next, we made a custom model
where we made a simple assumption that at a given department and store, there
was no variation year-over-year. More explicitly, we are assuming that the sales
at a given store at a given department would be the same as the same date 52
weeks ago. This method worked surprisingly well and, in our view, gave an excelletn cost-to-performance ratio.
