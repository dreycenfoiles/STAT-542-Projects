\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we were tasked with predicting the weekly sales of
different departments at several Walmart stores using data from 45 different
stores in different regions.

\section{Data processing}
The data categories in the raw dataset are as follows: Store, Dept, Date,
Weekly\_Sales, IsHoliday. To generate the training data, test data, and extra
training folds, we first remove Date and replace it with two new categories:
Week and Year. We assigned a number from 1 to 52 for each week, and a number
from 1 to 3 for each year. These categories are much easier for a statistical model to interpret.

\section{Methods}
To do the regression, we used a very simply model that we know was not going to perform as well as we hoped, but we did not have enough time to improve on. We simply assumed that there was no variation year-over-year. The sales at a given store at a given department would be the same as the same date 52 weeks ago. This method worked surprisingly well and, in our view, gave a ratio of accuracy to evaluation speed.
