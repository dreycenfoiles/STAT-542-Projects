\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we were tasked with predicting the weekly sales of different departments at several Walmart stores. This is a good test of our ability to make time series predictions based on previous data and how we can adapt existing models to more data. 

\section{Methods}
To do the regression, we used a very simply model that we know was not going to perform as well as we hoped, but we did not have enough time to improve on. We simply assumed that there was no variation year-over-year. The sales at a given store at a given department would be the same as the same date 52 weeks ago. This method worked surprisingly well and, in our view, gave a ratio of accuracy to evaluation speed.

\section{Conclusion}

We struggled to get more robust models to successfully predict weekly sales. Unfortunately, our best model was not good enough to beat all the benchmarks. We attempted to fit a linear using weeks as features for each department in each store, but that was producing predictions that were very off. In this end, by far our best model was simply predicting that weekly sales would not change year-over-year.
